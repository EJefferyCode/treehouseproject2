# treehouseproject2

<h1>This is another project that I've been working on whilst taking the web design course with Team Treehouse.</h1>
<p>Although I did not write all of the CSS code, I customized about 50% of the CSS3 code. This has been a good learning 
lesson in reading other people's code.</p>
